End of Support Announcement â€“ Cryo Kernel for Redmi Note 8

After much thought and reflection, Iâ€™ve decided to officially end support for the Redmi Note 8 and my custom kernel project, Cryo.

This journey has been incredible â€” full of learning, challenges, and growth. Maintaining Cryo has been a passion project, and I'm proud of what weâ€™ve built together. However, itâ€™s time for me to move on to new things.

To everyone who downloaded, tested, gave feedback, and believed in the project â€” thank you. Your support, trust, and enthusiasm made all of this worth it.
A special shoutout to our Telegram group â€” your energy kept the community alive and the development going.

This isnâ€™t a goodbye forever â€” just the end of this chapter.
Stay curious, keep experimenting, and never stop learning.
Much love to all of you ðŸ’™

â€” [lyahi]
